
1.fs module works on binary
2. read in detail in binary module
3. there are a lot of method and function in buffer module.
4. in this vedio we will read some of them

difference between simple and sync methods:
like a one of them is 
 readFile and reaFileSync
reaFileSync: its use is strickly prohibited,becuase it
stop our main thread upto it complete itself.
we use this one in special cases.

readFile: use generally, it not stopping the main thread like
in blow code
fs.readFile("./index.html", (err, data) => {
  const content = data.toString;
  console.log(content);
});
console.log("End");

first 'End' will print, because loading of file is not stopping the main thread.

Important is which one will we use,
we will not use any one of them but willuse 
 import fs from 'node:fs/promises'

 to check difference run code in app.js 
 with reaFileSync using only fs and with 
 readFile using fs/promises

 note: callback sytax also work same as readFile, but
 will create callback hell, that's why not using.
